# Next.js Login Page

This is a simple login page built using Next.js, TypeScript, Axios, `react-hook-form`, and `react-hot-toast`. The login process utilizes a fake API provided by [dummyjson](https://dummyjson.com/) to authenticate the user.

## Features

-   **Login Form**: A basic login form that uses `react-hook-form` for form handling.
-   **Error Handling**: Displays toast notifications using `react-hot-toast` for successful or failed login attempts.
-   **Fake API**: Uses [dummyjson](https://dummyjson.com/) fake API for simulating login functionality.
-   **TypeScript**: The project is written in TypeScript to ensure type safety.
